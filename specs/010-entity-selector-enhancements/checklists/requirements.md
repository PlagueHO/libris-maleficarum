# Specification Quality Checklist: Entity Type Selector Enhancements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items validated successfully. The specification is complete, technology-agnostic, and ready for the next phase.

### Validation Details

- **Content Quality**: All user stories focus on user value and business outcomes. No framework-specific or implementation details in core specification. Dependencies section appropriately notes technical prerequisites.
- **Requirements**: All 13 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria. No ambiguous language requiring clarification.
- **Success Criteria**: 7 measurable outcomes defined with specific metrics (90% recognition rate, 8+ visible items, 2-second task completion, 30% improvement, etc.)
- **Scope**: Clear boundaries established with 9 in-scope items and 8 out-of-scope items
- **Testing**: 4 prioritized user stories with 8 total acceptance scenarios plus 4 edge cases identified

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
